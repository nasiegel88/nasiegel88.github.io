title: About me
---

I’m Noah Siegel and I am an immunologist and bioinformatics enthusiast. 
I’m currently a PhD student at University of California, Davis in the Graduate Group in Immunology. I’m in the lab of Dr. [Lisa Miller](https://lmillerlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) 
.

I spend my research time:
1. Micrbiome characterization using [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) 
2. identifying devlopmentally regulated genes, is the rhesus macaque non-human primate model

I spend my teaching time:
1. Mentoring undergraduates as Graduate Student Mentor in [ESTEME](https://esteme.weebly.com) (Equity in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, and Entrepreneurship)
2. Working with [STEM SQAD](https://estemestemsquad.weebly.com) to expose students to the many potential careers within science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, and motivate them to pursue further education in these areas.


With my free time I like to:
1. Spend time at the beaches in San Diego
2. Run, bike, draw, and try out all the food places around Davis
