My project has recently involved a lot of immunofluorescences staining of mucins, so I wanted to show some of the images I have captured. Mucins are the primary protein component of mucous and play a role both trapping and removing bacteria from the lung.

It is still hard for me to wrap my mind around the numerous and evolutionary conserved mucins common in mammals. Mucins functions range from lubrication to cell signaling to forming chemical barriers.
