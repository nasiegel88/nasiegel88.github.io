## 1. List the 3 nearest genes upstream (towards the centromere) relative to TAZ
1. DNASE1L1
2. RPL10
3. SNORA70
## 2. Where relative to gene features is the H3K27Ac presence highest?
H3K27AC is most highly expressed in the promoter region of the TAZ gene
## 3. Note the double-lines in the MultiZ alignments of other vertebrate species. What do the double-lines mean? (google, or look in the help pages)
double line mean unalignable bases are in the gap region
## 4. Create a figure using the genome browser to highlight one potentially important feature around your Project 1 or Project 2 gene that may be relevant to its role in disease.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease that is a result of
complex interactions between genetics and the environment and has
limited treatment options. [Schartz et al,. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4722833/) have identified a MUC5B promoter polymorphism (rs35705950) and other common genetic variants that in
aggregate explain roughly one-third of disease risk. Furthermore, there is a CPG island on the 4th exon of MUC5B gene could possibly regulate MUC5B expression through its methylation but this has not been confirmed.
